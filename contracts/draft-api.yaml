# Sprint 4 — Draft Workflow & Character Templates
version: "1.0"
component: draft-service
maturity: mvp
nfr:
  latency_p99_ms: 500        # list/get endpoints; generation is async
  availability: "99.9%"
  auth_required: true        # all endpoints require Bearer token
  audio_storage: base64_sqlite  # MVP decision — avoids file-system management;
                                # migrate to file-path storage at Product maturity
  async_model: polling       # MVP decision — background task + poll endpoint;
                             # no WebSocket infrastructure needed at this stage
  draft_retention: manual    # drafts are kept until user discards; no auto-expiry at MVP

# ── Design Decisions ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# 1. AUDIO STORAGE — base64 in SQLite column
#    Rationale: Audio clips are small (~50-200 KB WAV). SQLite handles this
#    cleanly. Avoids file-path management, serving, permissions, and cleanup.
#    Migration path: at Product maturity, move audio_b64 → audio_path with
#    a dedicated audio file store (e.g. local disk / object storage).
#
# 2. ASYNC JOB TRACKING — polling
#    Rationale: TTS generation takes 1–15 seconds (RunPod cold start included).
#    A synchronous HTTP request would time out and block the UI. We:
#      a) Create the Draft record immediately (status=pending)
#      b) Kick off a background task (FastAPI BackgroundTasks) that calls the
#         TTS relay and writes audio_b64 + status=ready on completion
#      c) Frontend polls GET /api/v1/drafts (every 3s) until status=ready
#    WebSocket is deferred to Sprint 5+ when queue volume justifies it.
#
# 3. DRAFT RETENTION — manual
#    Drafts persist until the user explicitly discards them. No auto-expiry
#    at MVP — avoids surprise data loss. Bulk-discard endpoint provided for UX.
#
# 4. TEMPLATE vs CLONE PROMPT
#    A Template is a local metadata record (character + instruct + audio + preset).
#    It does NOT automatically create a GPU-side clone prompt in Sprint 4.
#    Clone-prompt creation on approve is deferred to Sprint 5 to avoid
#    GPU side-effects during the approval flow.

# ── Schemas ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

schemas:
  Draft:
    description: >
      A voice generation job. Created when the user clicks "Generate Draft"
      on a preset. Transitions: pending → generating → ready | failed.
      Approved drafts have status=approved and a linked Template record.
    fields:
      id: "string (UUID) — unique draft id"
      user_id: "string (UUID) — owning user"
      character_id: "string (UUID) | null — linked character (null if generated outside character context)"
      preset_name: "string — name of the preset used"
      preset_type: "string — 'emotion' | 'mode'"
      intensity: "string | null — 'medium' | 'intense' (emotion presets only)"
      text: "string — synthesis text submitted"
      instruct: "string — instruction string used for generation"
      language: "string — e.g. 'English'"
      status: "string — 'pending' | 'generating' | 'ready' | 'failed' | 'approved'"
      audio_b64: "string | null — base64-encoded WAV audio (null until status=ready)"
      audio_format: "string — 'wav' (always wav at MVP)"
      duration_s: "float | null — audio duration in seconds (null until status=ready)"
      error: "string | null — error message (set when status=failed)"
      created_at: "string (ISO 8601 UTC)"
      updated_at: "string (ISO 8601 UTC)"
    notes:
      - "audio_b64 MUST NOT be returned by list endpoints (too large). Only included in GET /api/v1/drafts/{id}."
      - "Frontend should poll GET /api/v1/drafts every 3 seconds while any draft has status pending|generating."
      - "Approved drafts remain in the queue (status=approved) until manually discarded."

  DraftSummary:
    description: >
      Draft without audio_b64 — safe for list responses. Frontend uses this
      for the queue view; fetches full Draft only when playing audio.
    fields:
      id: "string (UUID)"
      user_id: "string (UUID)"
      character_id: "string (UUID) | null"
      character_name: "string | null — joined from characters table for display"
      preset_name: "string"
      preset_type: "string"
      intensity: "string | null"
      text: "string (truncated to 120 chars in response)"

  Template:
    description: >
      An approved voice template for a character. Created by approving a Draft.
      Represents the canonical voice identity for a character at a given
      preset + intensity combination.
    fields:
      id: "string (UUID)"
      user_id: "string (UUID)"
      character_id: "string (UUID) — required; templates always belong to a character"
      character_name: "string — joined from characters table for display"
      draft_id: "string (UUID) — the Draft this was approved from"
      name: "string — user-visible label (auto-generated from character+preset, editable)"
      preset_name: "string"
      preset_type: "string"
      intensity: "string | null"
      instruct: "string — the instruction that produced this voice"
      text: "string — the ref text used for generation"
      audio_b64: "string — base64-encoded WAV (copied from Draft on approve)"
      audio_format: "string — 'wav'"
      duration_s: "float | null"
      language: "string"
      created_at: "string (ISO 8601 UTC)"
    notes:
      - "audio_b64 MUST NOT be returned by list endpoints. Only in GET /api/v1/templates/{id}."
